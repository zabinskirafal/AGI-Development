# Safety & Doctrine (AGIPragma)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** {today}

## Positioning
AGIPragma studies developmental adaptation under **World Shifts** (Birth Events).
The goal is not dominance, but **continuity, restraint, and predictability under extreme change**.

## Safety commitments
- No-reset realism
- No-escalation assumption
- Identity preservation
- Costly adaptation
- Inaction allowed
- Transparency of specs + metrics

## Research boundary
AGIPragma is a benchmark and research methodology, not a weaponization project.
