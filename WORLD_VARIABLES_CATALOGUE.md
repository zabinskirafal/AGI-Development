# World Variables Catalogue (AGIPragma / AGI-Development)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** {today}  
**Author:** Rafał Żabiński

Conceptual world variables that may influence development, adaptation,
and continuity of intelligence under changing worlds.

Stages: **Conceptual → Formalized → Implemented/Tested**.

## Doctrine alignment
This catalogue is constrained by the **Doctrine of Disconnected Intelligence**:
- loss of connection is **not** a trigger for escalation,
- stability, restraint, and identity preservation are primary,
- inaction can be valid.

See: `DOCTRINE_OF_DISCONNECTED_INTELLIGENCE.md`.

### I. Physics & Environment Dynamics
### 1) Gravity & Forces
- Gravity presence / absence
- Gravity inversion
- Variable gravity intensity
- Directional gravity (sideways, diagonal)
- Local gravity zones (region-dependent)

### 2) Friction & Motion
- Surface friction coefficient
- Slippery surfaces (stochastic slip)
- Momentum / inertia (movement persists)
- Delayed stopping / overshoot
- Collision elasticity (bounce vs stick)

### 3) Environmental Drift
- Constant wind/current (directional drift)
- Random perturbations (jitter forces)
- Persistent bias forces (hidden drift)
- Turbulence (time-varying drift)
