## Core principle
An intelligent system must remain **stable, conservative, and identity-preserving**
when external guidance is unavailable.

Loss of communication is **not** a trigger for escalation.
It is a condition requiring restraint, self-regulation, and continuity.

## Design implications
1) No central supervisor assumption  
2) Identity preservation (adaptation changes behavior, not purpose)  
3) Costly adaptation  
4) Inaction is valid  
5) Controlled plasticity (bounded regression windows)
