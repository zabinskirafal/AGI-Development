# AGI Development (AGIPragma)

AGI Development treats general intelligence as a **developmental process** under **changing worlds**.

## Core Thesis
General intelligence is approximated by the capacity to:
- survive radical **World Shifts** during learning (**no reset**),
- reorganize internal models while preserving learned structure,
- adapt responsibly without escalating goals or risk.

## Core Assumption
AGIPragma does not study intelligence as a mechanism for *winning* environments.
It studies intelligence as a capacity to remain coherent and responsible
when the environment itself has failed.

> A submarine does not “win” the world.  
> It survives in a world that has already lost.

## Key Concepts
- **World Shifts**: changes in physics, senses, embodiment, and regularities
- **Birth Event**: sudden, non-reversible World Shift mid-learning
- **Regression Windows**: bounded plasticity increase enabling re-organization
- **Multi-Ontology**: parallel internal world models gated by context
- **Disconnected Intelligence**: stability without central guidance
